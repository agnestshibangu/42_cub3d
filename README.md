# 🕹️ Cub3D

Welcome to **Cub3D**, a project developed as part of the 42 School curriculum. This project is an introduction to building a 3D game engine inspired by the iconic **Wolfenstein 3D**, using the raycasting technique.

## 🎮 Introduction

Cub3D is a minimalist 3D rendering engine designed to explore the fundamental concepts of graphical programming, such as:

- **Raycasting** for simulating 3D environments.
- Texture and color management.
- Distance and perspective calculations.

The project serves as a deep dive into game mechanics and rendering techniques, making it a great foundation for aspiring game developers.
